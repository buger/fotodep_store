Pods is a CMS framework for creating, managing, and deploying customized content types.

== Description ==

Check out http://podscms.org/ for our User Guide and many other resources to help you develop with Pods.

= Create your own content types =
A Pod is a content type which contains a user-defined set of fields. Each content type is stored in it's own table, where as WordPress Custom Post Types are normally all stored in one single table for them all.

Create a variety of different fields including: text, paragraph text, date, number, file upload, and relationship (called "pick") fields.

Pick fields are useful if you want to create relationships between your content types. One example is if you want to relate an "event" with one or more "speaker".

= Easily display your content =
There are several ways to get Pods data to show up throughout your site:

* Add Pod Pages from within the admin area. Pod Pages support PHP and Wildcard URLs. For example, the Pod Page "events/*" will be the default handler for all pages beginning with "events/". This allows you to have a single page to handle a myriad of different items.
* Add PHP code directly into your WP template files, or wherever else PHP is supported.
* Use shortcode to display lists of Pod items or details of a Pod item within WP Pages or Posts.
* The Pods API allows you to retrieve raw data from and save data to the database.

= Customized Management Panels =
Utilize Pods UI (included in Pods 1.10+) to build your own Custom Management panels for your Pods.

= Migrate! =
Pods includes a Package Manager, which allows you to import/export Pods (structure-only, no data yet), Pod Templates, Pod Pages, and/or Pod Helpers. You can select which features you want to "package up" and export it for easy migration to other sites or to share your code with other users in our Package Directory.

Pods also includes an easy to use PHP API to allow you to import and export your data via CSV, and other more complex operations.

== Changelog ==

= 1.11 - August 12, 2011 =
* Improved: MySQL performance enhanced with a number of MySQL indexes and column type tweaks, your DB will be automatically upgraded for you
* Added: PodInit :: setup now has filters / actions that run before / after install and updates
* Added: PodInit :: setup now explicitly sets CHARSET / COLLATE options as defined in wp-config ($wpdb->charset / $wpdb->collate)
* Added: PodInit :: precode now runs action 'pods_page_precode' after a Pod Page's precode is run (if any) and allows you to intercept the global $pods variable to force a Pod Page to stop running (issue a 404 by $pods = 404;) and other modifications to $pods global
* Added: PodInit :: admin_menu now checks if PODS_DISABLE_ADMIN_MENU is defined and set to true, which will hide all of the Pods menus (except for top-level Pod menus)
* Added: PodInit :: wp_head now checks if PODS_DISABLE_VERSION_OUTPUT is defined and set to true, which will hide the Pods version from Pod Pages
* Added: Set Meta Property Tags in your Pod Page precode, just setup $pods on your Pod object, and assign $pods->meta_properties as an array with any other meta property tags you want put on that page (useful for quick and dynamic meta tags dependant on Pod information)
* Bugfix: Pods UI bug with filters / searches not working fixed, added a $strict variable to pods_ui_var and pods_var for clearer values (strict mode returns default if value found is empty)
* Bugfix: Fixed pods_var bug with strtolower PHP warning when managing content
* Bugfix: PodAPI :: export_package now removes sister_field_id from field data being exported as it could cause issues with incorrect bi-directional mapping to fields on reimport (expect to rebuild bi-directional field relationships upon import of packages going forward)
* Bugfix: PodAPI :: save_column now reserves the field names 't' and 'p' for internal use as aliases
* Bugfix: Pod :: lookup_row_ids now forces (int) on values given, also allows $tbl_row_ids to be array instead of only just comma-separate string as before
* Bugfix: Pod :: findRecords now looks in 'select' parameter to find fields that need to be included
* Bugfix: Pod :: showform now forces (int) on explicitly values that hit the DB
* Bugfix: Various PHP notice fixes and query updates to improve performance (to maximize performance on custom queries, update wp_pod queries to use datatype first then tbl_row_id if it's not already in WHERE statements, do same for wp_pod_rel on field_id and pod_id)

= 1.10.7 - August 9, 2011 =
* Bugfix: Fix for /ui/ajax/api.php which added extra slashes unnecessarily

= 1.10.6 - August 9, 2011 =
* Added: pods_var function to replace pods_url_variable (better name, more functionality), now handles URL segments, $_GET, $_POST, $_SESSION, $_COOKIE, $_SERVER, CONSTANT, User meta, custom arrays, and custom objects - also added a $default option to set what it should default to if not found (default: null) - also added a $allowed option to set what values are allowed to be returned, if $output is not $allowed ($allowed is array and not in $allowed OR $allowed is not array and does not equal $allowed) then $default is returned
* Added: pods_var_set function to set variables, operates similar to pods_var, has three variables ($value, $key, $type) and returns $value on success (if $type is an array or object it will return the updated $type, if $type is 'url' it will return the full updated $url)
* Bugfix: Now using get_current_url() and parse_url to get path versus $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']
* Bugfix: Replaced mysql_real_escape_string usage with esc_sql
* Bugfix: Fixed backslashes being automatically added and causing issues with additional urlencoding and esc_attr usage

= 1.10.5 - August 9, 2011 =

* Bugfix: When adding a helper, it will now be added to the 'input helper' drop-down too
* Bugfix: Pods non-top-level management has session filters turned off now by default
