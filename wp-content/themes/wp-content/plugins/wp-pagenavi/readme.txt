[Demo](http://lesterchan.net/wordpress/) | [Translations](http://dev.wp-plugins.org/browser/wp-pagenavi/trunk/lang/)

== Installation ==

You can either install it automatically from the WordPress admin, or do it manually:

1. Unzip the archive and put the `wp-pagenavi` folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
1. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.

= Usage =

1. Open `wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/footer.php`
2. Add anywhere: `<?php wp_pagenavi(); ?>`
3. Go to *WP-Admin -> Settings -> PageNavi* to configure WP-PageNavi.

= Changing the CSS =

If you need to configure the CSS style of WP-PageNavi, you can copy the `pagenavi-css.css` file from the plugin directory to your theme's directory and make your modifications there. This way, you won't lose your changes when you update the plugin.

Alternatively, you can uncheck the "Use pagenavi.css?" option from the settings page and add the styles to your theme's style.css file directly.


== Screenshots ==

1. Default appearance
2. Options page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Error on activation: "Parse error: syntax error, unexpected..." =

Make sure your host is running PHP 5. The only foolproof way to do this is to add this line to wp-config.php (after the opening `<?php` tag):

`var_dump(PHP_VERSION);`

= Doesn't work with query_posts() =
